<!--The == true is innecessary, since it takes a boolean value-->
<div>
  User Name: <input type="text" name="username" [(ngModel)]="username" />
  <!-- ngModel is an angular feature that binds the value of this input named username to the model -->
  <!-- ngModel is double way data binding: when the data changes in the component.ts it changes on the page, and when it changes on the page it goes back to here-->

  Password:
  <input type="password" name="password" [(ngModel)]="password" />
  <!--We did data binding by using the variables username and password defined in the component.ts file-->
  <!-- Now let's do the banana in a box model for password-->

  <!-- Username: {{ username }} -->

  <!-- Now we are going to use event binding -->
  <button (click)="handleLogin()">Login</button>
  <!-- All the methods are defined in the login.component.ts -->
  <!--This method is just printing the username and the password in the console-->
  <!-- event binding allows us to bind an event (click) to a component event method-->
</div>
